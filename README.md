# Express.js Note Taker
  
## Description
The goal of this project was to connect a pre-existing front-end user-interface with functional code that allows the user to create and save notes to a database file. This was accomplished with the 'Express.js' npm package along with the built-in 'Node.js' methods pertaining to the file system (fs).

Using this application is quite simple. Simply select the '+' icon in the top right to display the new note entry fields (title & content). Entering both values will illuminate the save icon in the top right corner.
